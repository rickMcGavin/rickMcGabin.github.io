              In 1970, Fischer began a new effort to become World Champion. His dramatic march toward the title made him a household name and made chess front-page news. He won the title in 1972, but forfeited it three years later.

            <p>
              Brian carney stated, "The world championship he won ... validated his view of himself as a chess player, but it also insulated him from the humanizing influences of the world around him. He descended into ... madness"
